## About
I'm a junior programmer learning Web Development, currently focused on a **SpringBoot/Angular** stack.
I love games, science fiction media, data science, and of course programming.
I am looking for career oportunities that make use of my skills and challenge me to learn more.

I have some college, but for the last year I've been self-taught for personal reasons.
It's going well, though I do plan on returning to college once I have that sorted out.
I have many repositories here on GitHub, and my focus project right now is the [Bookstore-API](https://github.com/G4brielMedeiros/Bookstore-api)/[Bookstore-Front.](https://github.com/G4brielMedeiros/bookstore-front)
This project is intended for me to learn, practice, and demonstrate my Web Dev skills, I will make more projects with this stack in the future.
